Here’s a breakdown of the core testing strategies implemented:

Technique	Description
✅ MC/DC	Modified Condition/Decision Coverage
🔄 State Transitioning	Validating system behavior in various states
➗ Equivalence Partitioning	Dividing input data into valid/invalid classes
📉 Boundary Value Analysis	Testing edge conditions for robustness

📄 What’s Included
📘 A detailed Test Plan

🧾 Designed Test Cases

📊 Testing Reports

🛠️ Hands-on implementation of various testing strategies

🚧 Project Status
⚠️ Still in Progress!
A more polished and feature-rich version is on its way — stay tuned for updates!
